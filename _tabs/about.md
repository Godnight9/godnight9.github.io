    <h3>🙋 Who am I:</h3>
    <p>A college student, and also a part-time Server O&M with over 8 years of experience. I'm aspired to be a Full-Stack software engineer and a IT professional. I love to work with software development, server management, classic versions of operating system, and retro computers.</p>
    <h3>💭 My thoughts:</h3>
    <p>A few years ago, I have very ambitious plans for the future. But now I know that the only thing I can control is the present moment. Instead of looking to the future, I should enjoy the present.</p>
